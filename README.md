**SCRIPT 2**

For this project, I tried to combine two labs that were taught in the Python Programming class to create a script. I was taught in class to scrape an image from Wikipedia, but I Web scraped an image from another website for this project. I was taught to use the basic elements of creating a chat bot, but for this project I created a branched chat bot script that makes use of information from the web scraped image.

In this script, an online image from medpagetoday.com that contains information about the 3 Covid-19 vaccines currently available in the U.S. is web scraped to be downloaded locally. Then, a chat bot function called “Covid-19 vaccine FAQs” will be created that will use the information from the downloaded image to provide vaccine related information to its users. This chatbot function takes a Covid-19 vaccine company name as an input (Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen), followed by the subcategories as an input (Vaccine name, MOA, Dosing schedule, Efficacy), to produce an output containing specific information within the subcategories of each individual Covid-19 vaccine company.

The resources I used to create this script were the link to the webpage from where the image was scraped (url: https://www.medpagetoday.com/specialreports/exclusives/91489). To web scrape the image, I referenced the section “Scraping images” under the tutorial assignment on Clark Moodle titled “Web-scraping in Depth” from the Python Programming class.  To create the chat bot function, I referenced the section “Create your first chat bot” under the lab assignment on Clark Moodle titled “Data classification and chat bots” from the Python Programming class.  

In the future, I would like to incorporate a dictionary within this project with multiple lists containing ‘key’: values features and do calculations with them, such as web scraping live text information about the doses available of a certain Covid-19 vaccine company at a vaccination site, and the number of people registered to get the vaccine at the site offering the Covid-19 vaccine of that company, in order to calculate how many doses of a certain Covid-19 vaccine company are still available at the particular vaccination site for people to be registered. I could code this information in the chat bot for users to make a better decision about the vaccine they would like to receive. I would also like to web scrape some text information in future regarding qualitative data about the Covid-19 vaccines.

A major error that I was encountering while creating the chat bot was that the input letters are Case sensitive. I figured it out after a couple failed attempts in trying to receive an output. I would like to fix this error while creating chat bots in future.
